Hangman Game

This project is a hangman music theme game done using jQuery. The player has a finite amount of guesses before a new word is chosen. If the player guesses the word correctly a picture of the artist is displayed and a song of theirs automatically plays.

This project was completed to enhance my understanding of javascript logic and principles like if/else statements, functions, callback functions etc...It also combined previous knowledge of css, html, and bootstrap.
